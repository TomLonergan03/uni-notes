# f is o(g)
$f$ is asymptotically smaller than $g$
$f$ is eventually bounded above by $g$ no matter what
Defined as:
$\forall c > 0. \exists N. \forall n \geq N. f(n)<cg(n)$

Can consider as $f<g$

$f$ is asymptotically larger than $g$
$f$ is eventually bounded below by $g$ no matter what
Defined as:
$\forall C > 0. \exists N. \forall n \geq N. f(n) > Cg(n)$

Can consider as $f>g$

# f is O(g)
$f$ is asymptotically upper bounded by $g$
$f$ is bounded above by $g$ for some $Cg$
Defined as:
$\exists C > 0. \exists N. \forall n\geq N.f(n)\leq Cg(n)$
