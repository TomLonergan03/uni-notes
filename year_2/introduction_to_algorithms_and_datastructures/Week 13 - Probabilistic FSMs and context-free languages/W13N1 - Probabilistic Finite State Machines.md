A **deterministic** Finite State Machine (FSM) is an FSM in which there is only one possible transition for any input in any state.
A **nondeterministic** FSM may have many possible transitions for an input in some or many states.
A **probabilistic** FSM has many possible transitions for an input, like a nondeterministic FSM, however, each transition for an input has a probability associated with it. This means that a string is no longer definitely accepted or rejected, but instead has a probability of being accepted.
