The [[W18N1 - Computability#Church-Turing thesis|CT thesis]] tells us that for any machine, there will be mathematical questions that machine can't answer.
This idea then brings us to Gödel's dichotomy:
"Either . . . the human mind (even within the realm of pure mathematics) infinitely surpasses the powers of any finite machine, or else there exist absolutely unsolvable diophantine problems." \- Gödel, 1952

Gödel [proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) that any consistent formal system for maths proofs will leave some questions unanswered, and this brings us back to the dichotomy.
