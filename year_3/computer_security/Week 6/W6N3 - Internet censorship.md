[[W6N2 - Anonymous communications|Anonymous communications]] are often used to evade government or corporate censorship.

Censorship often takes the form of a [[W2N4 - Firewalls|firewall]] which block traffic to specific sites. This can be bypassed using proxies, but these are regularly shut down by many censorship regimes.

# Censor resistant strategies
- **No single point of failure:** ensure that content that censors wish to hide are hosted in many places, making it harder to shut down all of them
	- Use multiple access paths
	- Spread the content across many jurisdictions, regions, and operators
	- This requires cooperation and redundant hosts
- **Collateral damage:** ensure that if a censor blocks a site for containing prohibited material, it also blocks other, censor approved, content also
	- It must be difficult to isolate allowed usage from the disallowed usage, so an attempt to block the undesired traffic would have a significant negative impact on the allowed usage
	- This is reliant on the censor caring about whatever approved uses that site has
- **Do not look suspicious:** make it difficult to determine if the traffic is something that the censors want to hide
	- Try to look either different enough from disallowed usage, or exactly like allowed usage, or using a tunnel though an allowed application
- **Be untraceable:** make it difficult to find what servers actually host the content, making it harder to block it
