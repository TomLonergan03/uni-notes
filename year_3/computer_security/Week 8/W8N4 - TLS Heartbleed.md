TLS has a "heartbeat", i.e. the client sends a message to a server saying "if you are there, respond to me with this n byte message \<message>" to which the server responds with the message. The server does not however check if the message is actually n bytes, and will instead just respond with the next n bytes in its memory, so by asking for a 64 KB message in response, the client can leak 64 KB of the server's memory per request.
