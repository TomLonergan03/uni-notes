Cryptography is the scientific study of techniques for securing digital information, transactions, and distributed computations.

Cryptographic methods are powerful tools at the core of many security mechanisms, used:
- to securely and confidentially access a website
- to attest the identity of the organisation operating a web server
- to encrypt phone calls
- to enforce access control in a multi-user operating system
- to prevent thieves extracting trade secrets from stolen laptops
- to prevent software copying
