**Application layer protocols** define how messages should be formed, before they are passed to a [[W3N3 - Transportation services|transportation service]]. These protocols define:
- The types of messages that can be exchanged
- The syntax of each message type, such as fields and their delimiters
- The semantics of the fields (the fields' meanings)
- Rules for how and when to send or respond to messages
