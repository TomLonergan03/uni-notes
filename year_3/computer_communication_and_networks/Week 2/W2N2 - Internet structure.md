The internet is assembled from a collection of ISPs of different scales:
- A small number of large networks
	- "Tier-1" commercial ISPs (e.g. BT, Virgin Media, Sprint, AT&T) which provide national and international coverage
	- Content provider networks (e.g. Google, Facebook) - private networks for connecting data centres to the internet, bypassing tier-1 and regional ISPs
- A large number of small networks
	- Various lower tier ISPs, which resell access to some tier 1 ISP hardware or using their own regional networks
- IXPs are internet exchange points, which allow various ISPs to connect to each other
